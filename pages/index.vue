I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Harvard University, where I study collective robotics with Prof. Radhika Nagpal in the [Self-organizing Systems Research group](https://ssr.seas.harvard.edu/). During my PhD, I have been a [Siebel Scholar](https://www.siebelscholars.com/) and Department of Energy [Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) (DOE CSGF), and I interned at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Previously, I earned an MRes in Bioengineering at Imperial College London as a Marshall Scholar and a BS in Behavioral Neuroscience at Northeastern University.

I am interested in robotics, learning, biology, and the interface between them, such as bio-inspired robotics, cooperative robot control, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems. I also consider myself a full-stack roboticist, working on both software (algorithms and control) and hardware (mechanical and electronic design). This lets me consider mechanical and algorithmic co-design in developing robust robot collectives.

My current research focuses on creating algorithms for distributed decision-making in robot swarms. Specifically, I am developing a modular framework for allowing robots to collectively solve a variety of environmental classification and localization problems. I aim to take an interdisciplinary approach to collective robotics, integrating bio-inspiration and mathematical modeling to develop algorithms that can be applied beyond the lab. After my PhD, I plan to pursue a career in academic or industry research.

I am also excited about science communication and outreach â€“ especially when it can be used to expand excitement and access to STEM for traditionally under-representend groups, including women and people of color. I've [spoken to hundreds of kids about robots](https://www.brainson.org/shows/2018/05/08/what-was-the-first-robot-and-more-from-robotstravaganza), given a [public lecture on robotics](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/seminars/2018/november-14-brains-bodies-make-smart-robots/) through Harvard's Science in the News lecture series, and demonstrated our lab's Kilobots at a variety of outreach events.

## Recent News

**September 2020:** I've been selected as a [Siebel Scholar](https://www.siebelscholars.com/) for the [Class of 2021](https://www.siebelscholars.com/articles/welcome-class-of-2021-siebel-scholars/)!

**August 2020:** I presented my research at the 2020 DOE CSGF Annual Program Review. You can [watch the recording here](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/conf/2020/video/ebert2016).

**May 2020:** My latest paper was published at ICRA 2020: "Bayes Bots: Collective Bayesian Decision-Making in Decentralized Robot Swarms." You can [read the preprint here](/pdfs/inproceedings/2020_icra.pdf) and [watch a recording of my talk here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvDgHfGTbOQ)

**September 2019:** I just made [Kilosim](https://github.com/jtebert/kilosim) open source! Together with [Richard Barnes](http://rbarnes.org/), I've been developing this scalable, high performance simulator for Kilobot robots that makes it easy to transfer code between simulation and physical robots. Although it's still in pre-release, it has been used to simulate up to 10,000 robots at a time and conduct parameter sweeps covering almost a million trials.
