          <p>Together with Buse Atkaş, I gave a public lecture on robotics. We covered what it means for a robot to be smart, and how we can use different techniques from mechanics, biology, and learning, and collaboration to build better robots.</p>
          <p>A video of the lecture will be available soon at the link below!</p>
